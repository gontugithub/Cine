# CINE
Is the first semireal proyect I made in my degree of DAM.
## WHATS ABOUT 
It's just a cinema where you can see the differents rooms and what film are proyecting in them,
also you can book a seat in the room you want and see the matrix of the seats availables
## USAGE 
In this proyect I use [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) for commits I attach here the command that you have to execute
inside the repo on local.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```
```bash
sudo apt install npm
```
```bash
sudo npm install commitizen -g
```
```bash
commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save-dev --save-exact
```
When you finish the installation and you want to create a new commit use this command:
```bash
git cz
```
